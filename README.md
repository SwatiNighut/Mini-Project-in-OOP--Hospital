# Mini-Project-in-OOP--Hospital

This is mini project in OOP for hospital staff

This project is made in OOP. 
This was trial of making program which will useful to keep the record of hospital staff. One will easily get information when needed.
 In this program I used the Python functions, OOP programming pillars like Constructor, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Class, Object etc.
This program provides the information about some personal data of staff and official information.
First class is hospital that includes staff other than doctor and nurse. Which will give total count and other information?
Second class is nurse which inherited information from parent hospital class .punch time which will tell us which nurse is there for that particular shift.
Third class is doctor which also inherited information from parent hospital class. How many doctors are present in the hospital?  Which specialist doctors are there?  Which nurses are working under the doctor? And we can also add or remove particular nurse under the doctor.

Conclusion:
The program is completely OOP based which will help to find the information instead of looking whole data.
